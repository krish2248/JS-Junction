To Sum Up;
A minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
- to make it live, run "npm run build" it creates the "dist" folder, then compress the dist folder and upload it to the file manager(futher process you can find it on youtube) of respective hosting services.
